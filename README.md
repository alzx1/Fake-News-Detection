## Introduction

The Fake News Detection project aims to demonstrate how to use machine learning techniques to identify fake news articles. It utilizes a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake to train models that can classify news articles based on their authenticity.

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides step-by-step instructions and code snippets to guide you through the process of analyzing the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the models, and evaluating their performance.

## Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset of news articles, where each article is labeled as either real or fake. The dataset can be obtained from various sources such as fact-checking organizations or online repositories. The dataset typically includes features such as the news article text, the article source, and the article label.

## Installation

To run the notebook and experiment with the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/alzx1/Fake-News-Detection.git


2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook


4. Open the `fake-news-detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

## Usage

The notebook provides detailed explanations of each step involved in the fake news detection, including:

- Data loading and exploration
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training different classification models (e.g., logistic regression, naive Bayes)
- Evaluating and comparing the model performance
- Predicting the authenticity of new news articles using the trained models

Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to execute the code and observe the results. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different approaches or models.
